# Todolog Roadmap

Last Updated: 2026-03-24
Owner: Product + Engineering

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap tracks:

- completed milestones (with dates)
- current focus
- upcoming work by priority

For implementation truth, see `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
For execution rules, see `.kiro/steering/requirements.md`.

## 2. Current Focus

Current state:

- Phase 2.5 data normalization is complete
- Sync hardening (`Pending Push -> Delta Pull`) is complete
- Phase 3 recurrence engine core (Step 1) is complete/validated
- Phase 3 common query/aggregation layer (Step 2) is complete/validated
- Phase 3 screen-adapter layer (Step 3) is complete/validated
- Category write unification is complete/validated
- Completion write unification is implemented; primary recovery/rerun-latch validation is complete
- Completion coalescing is implemented and validated
- Completion local tombstone is implemented and validated
- Guest local-only bootstrap + all-to-Inbox migration is implemented and validated (iOS simulator + Maestro login/signup branch verification complete, forced signup partial-failure boundary verified)
- Cache-policy unification (Option A -> Option B) is complete/validated
- Todo Calendar V2 readiness is complete/validated on web and native baseline checks
- Todo Calendar V2 cutover + legacy retirement landed: `calendar` tab now points to TC2, the duplicate standalone `TC2` tab route has been removed, and the old monthly calendar runtime has been removed from active app code
- Post-cutover promoted native smoke is still pending before any legacy-retirement decision
- Strip-calendar remains legacy/spec reference only and is no longer mounted in the active Todo runtime
- Week Flow Calendar is active on `TodoScreen` header (`WeekFlowTodoHeader`) with monthly drag-snap + monthly->weekly recenter on iOS-validated path; dedicated `week-flow` tab has been removed
- Expo Router migration is complete/validated (file-based routing under `client/app/`)
- Expo SDK 55 upgrade is complete/validated; Android emulator + iOS simulator smoke both passed
- Floating tab bar implementation has landed: the product shell now uses a detached custom tab bar with a three-tab menu shell, a separate circular `+` quick action, shared reserved inset hooks, blurred shared surface, and animated moving selected pill
- Floating tab bar iOS simulator validation passed after rebuilding the dev client for `expo-blur`/`react-native-svg`; Android/manual parity validation is still pending
- `react-native-wheel-pick` remains as the only non-blocking Expo doctor warning and is slated for later native replacement

Immediate objective:

- maintain sync operational stability (retry/dead-letter/throughput monitoring)
- reduce runtime debug log noise after Phase 3 integration
- finish post-cutover promoted native smoke for Todo Calendar V2 and decide legacy monthly-calendar retirement timing
- finish Week Flow Calendar Android/manual parity validation and keep docs/spec aligned with the Todo header runtime
- leave strip-calendar as legacy reference only unless later archive/removal work is explicitly scheduled
- prepare next feature track on top of common layer + screen-adapter contracts
- post Expo Router migration: ensure deep-link/push route parity and keep legacy navigation deps at 0
- finish floating tab bar Android/manual parity smoke after the iOS-validated detached-shell rollout
- replace `react-native-wheel-pick` with native UI after the SDK 55 stabilization window

## 4. Next Milestones (Planned)

## P0: Phase 3 Integration Hardening

Target:

- stabilize post-integration runtime on top of common query/aggregation + screen-adapter contracts

Priority checks:

1. remove or gate verbose debug logs in runtime-critical paths
2. keep active surface consistency checks (`TodoScreen`, `TodoCalendarV2`, `WeekFlowTodoHeader`) regression-safe
3. ensure stale/fresh transition behavior remains deterministic after sync

## P1: Reliability and Operational Hardening

- reduce noisy debug logs in runtime-critical paths
- improve smoke-test checklist automation
- tighten rollback checklist for migration scripts

## P2: Data Lifecycle Policy

- define retention/cleanup policy for old completions
- define policy for long-lived soft-deleted records

## P3: UX and Product Expansion

- incremental UI/UX polish for calendar and form flows
- evaluate additional platforms/features after Phase 3 stability

## 5. Parking Lot

These are intentionally deferred until P0/P1 are stable:

- deep sync architecture redesign beyond current service model
- advanced recurrence UI redesign
- long-term analytics/performance instrumentation program

## 6. Update Policy

When a milestone is completed:

1. Add exact date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
2. Add concise outcome
3. Add evidence link (spec log, task file, or commit range)
4. Move item from planned -> completed

When scope changes:

- update this roadmap and the corresponding feature specs in the same working session
