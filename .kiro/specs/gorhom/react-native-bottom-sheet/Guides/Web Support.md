Web Support
Supporting Web has been on my list since day 0 (issue #11), but unfortunately was not a priority until the community start adopting solutions such as Expo Web, which also provided an easier development setup for me to kick off the development.

With v5 release, users will be able to use the library in web mobile without changing the API 🪄.

Setup
In order to use the bottom sheet on web, you would need to follow the instructions from Reanimated documentation.
